## Storing data

No real database was implemented to build this application since there was no clear need for it, all the data is stored in local storage, and can be easily purged when clearing the local storage in the browser (not really needed since you still can delete all favorite elements and update the local storage, from the favorites list when navigating to it from the navbar items)

## Responsiveness

The CSS framework Materialize was used to define the styling in the project, which is a fast and efficient way to build responsive web apps.
